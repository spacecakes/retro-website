# Retro Website of gabriellundmark.com

## Why?

This started as a joke in 2010 when I installed a server for entirely different reasons. The site has been running ever since with little tweaks to keep the terrible audio playing in HTML5. (MIDI worked for a long time though and `<marquee>` still does!) Now I kind of like it and can't let it go. It has no other purpose. Why are you even reading this?

## 2018 rewrite

In 2018, I rewrote the thing properly with modern conventions to keep it running in modern browsers. I changed the wording slightly to make the joke about Internet Explorer specifically and let the site serve as fallback for legacy browsers. Don't worry! It's still as crude as ever and sporting the original beautiful 90s look.
