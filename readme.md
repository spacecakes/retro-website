# Retro Website of gabriellundmark.com

## Purpose

This started as a joke in 2010 when I installed a server for entirely different reasons. The site has been running ever since with little tweaks to keep the terrible audio playing in HTML5. (MIDI worked for a long time though and `<marquee>` still does!)

## 2018 rewrite

In 2018, I rewrote the thing properly with modern conventions to keep it running in modern browsers. I changed the wording somewhat to make the joke about Internet Explorer specifically to let the site serve a purpose as an old browser fallback. Don't worry! It's still as crude as ever and sporting the original beautiful 90s look.
